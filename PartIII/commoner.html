                <p>What could a young girl ask for, 
                    but the company of another who understood?
                    How many times had the princess dreamed, <br>
                    of sneaking into town, befriending someone her age?
                    Rank meant nothing to her, <br>
                    but the princess was too cowardly to leave 
                    her small world, this huge castle. <br>
                    But one day, right there in her usual haunt, 
                    the library of old glorious battles, <br>
                    recorded to be remembered,
                    yet read by no one… <br>
                    A young girl, just like she dreamed of, 
                    burst in! And the princess was…
                    </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>“Thoroughly creeped out,” I said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Eh? Huh? Excuse me? Sorry? Do you perhaps lack the most fundamental of reading comprehension?” Shiori was hopping mad apparently. Not sure why. “The story JUST spent an entire page talking about how much she wanted a friend.”
                
            </p>
            <p>
                “People don’t always know what they want. It’s creepy that the girl snuck into the castle. Sometimes I wish I had no ears. Do you think I’d actually be happy if that happened?”
                
            </p>
            <p>
                “You… You! Are you being sincerely serious right now?!”
                
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait, are you… I mean, I’m not talking about you or anything! Are you actually taking this personally? It’s a story, Shiori! Do I look like a princess?”
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Okay, I won’t lie, I do think Shiori can be really creepy sometimes, but I feel like I stepped on her toes one too many times and she’s understandably a tad touchy. Also, I think Yorick favoring me a little probably hurt her feelings.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why I hold him out to her, and now his teary face seems to be one of contrition and forgiveness. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yorick, oh! I’ll never use you as glue again!” She takes and cradles him like he’s the most precious thing in the world, before happily putting him on her shoulder and turning to me sheepishly. “Ah, ahem. I got a little sensitive there, so do forgive me. Now, as we were continuing with the story…”
