                <p>“I came here because I wanted to read.
                    Isn’t that alright?”<br> <br>
                    
                    "Well, obviously not!” said the princess,
                    though she couldn’t quite remember, <br>
                    what made that so obvious. <br> <br>
                    
                    Sad, but understanding. 
                    She was that kind of good-natured girl. <br>
                    “Then I don’t want to trouble you…
                    so I shall go. It was wonderful to meet you.” <br>
                    But the princess grabbed her hand, and said:
                    “It’s fine, don’t go! I’m technically a princess. <br>
                    They technically have to listen to me!
                    It’ll be okay,” she said, though she wasn’t certain. <br>
                    “But um, if you see an adult, do please hide.”
                    The princess peered about the library,  <br>
                    even thought she knew no one came there.
                    That’s when the thought struck her strange, <br>
                    “Why, you say you came here to read…
                    but all that’s here are old war books!” the princess cried out. <br>
                    Now she was really suspicious!
                    
                    “Oh, isn’t it great?”
                    But the girl did not flinch. <br>
                    Her smile just got brighter.
                    “The real stories of those who fought… <br>
                    for good, or for bad. 
                    For freedom or for tyranny. <br>
                    They’re both worth remembering, 
                    don’t you think?” <br><br>
                    
                    The truth was, the princess did not think.
                    At least not about soldiers, very much.  <br>
                    Or the past. Or the people who died in it.
                    Certainly she didn’t think about the bad guys. <br>
                    What was the big deal if they were forgotten? <br> <br>
                    
                    But for the first time, the girl frowned.
                    “No one deserves to be forgotten, you know. <br>
                    Even the worst of us.” 
                    The princess just could not agree.  <br>
                    Yet it mattered not. Right in the princess’s hands,
                    was a book handed to her by her new friend. <br> <br>
                    
                    
                    “This one’s a sweeping epic…
                    and this one’s like a fairy tale!” <br>
                    her new friend yelled excitedly,
                    with very poor volume control. <br>
                    “Shush! They’ll hear you!
                    What war story could possibly resemble a fairy tale?”   <br><br>
                    
                    
                    And before the princess knew it, she was enamored.
                    By stories of soldiers who were saved, <br>
                    by love letters in their breast pocket. <br>
                    By long and complicated stories of nations,  
                    spanning generations. Including her own family! <br><br>
                    
                    
                    By the time it was dark,
                    the princess was quite sad.  <br>
                    “Will I ever see you again?” she asked.
                    “You’ll see me again, tomorrow!” <br>
                    And for the first time, the princess’s tears, <br>
                    were happy ones.
