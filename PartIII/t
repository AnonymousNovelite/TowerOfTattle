"Well, obviously not!” said the princess,
though she couldn’t quite remember, 
what made that so obvious.

Sad, but understanding. 
She was that kind of good-natured girl.
“Then I don’t want to trouble you…
so I shall go. It was wonderful to meet you.”
But the princess grabbed her hand, and said:
“It’s fine, don’t go! I’m technically a princess.
They technically have to listen to me!
It’ll be okay,” she said, though she wasn’t certain.
“But um, if you see an adult, do please hide.”
The princess peered about the library, 
even thought she knew no one came there.
That’s when the thought struck her strange,
“Why, you say you came here to read…
but all that’s here are old war books!” the princess cried out.
Now she was really suspicious!

“Oh, isn’t it great?”
But the girl did not flinch. 
Her smile just got brighter.
“The real stories of those who fought…
for good, or for bad. 
For freedom or for tyranny.
They’re both worth remembering,
don’t you think?”

The truth was, the princess did not think.
At least not about soldiers, very much. 
Or the past. Or the people who died in it.
Certainly she didn’t think about the bad guys.
What was the big deal if they were forgotten?

But for the first time, the girl frowned.
“No one deserves to be forgotten, you know.
Even the worst of us.” 
The princess just could not agree. 
Yet it mattered not. Right in the princess’s hands,
was a book handed to her by her new friend.


“This one’s a sweeping epic…
and this one’s like a fairy tale!”
her new friend yelled excitedly,
with very poor volume control.
“Shush! They’ll hear you!
What war story could possibly resemble a fairy tale?”  


And before the princess knew it, she was enamored.
By stories of soldiers who were saved,
by love letters in their breast pocket.
By long and complicated stories of nations, 
spanning generations. Including her own family!


By the time it was dark,
the princess was quite sad. 
“Will I ever see you again?” she asked.
“You’ll see me again, tomorrow!”
And for the first time, the princess’s tears,
were happy ones.

But it was too late!
For bad ideas always spring on their chance.
They snuck into the kitchen… 
and packed themselves lunches to last,
at least, 
till 9PM.


They snuck into the royal dressery, 
and found coats too big, but superbly warm,
and dragged them through quite a lot of dirt,
before abandoning them near a creek.


“I believe I’ve made a mistake!” 
the princess cried out to the heavens,
because she, in fact, did.

“Do you even know where we are?”

“Of course I do! We’re in a swamp!”

For the first time in her life, 
the princess felt some fight in her fists.

That was about two hundred pages ago. Just like the book told us, the mystery forest that no one ever escaped from, happens to be extremely hard to escape from. What an idea. What a revelation. How could we possibly have known?

“You should’ve picked the berries!” I shout. “The princess was hungry. If you picked the berries she wouldn’t have fainted before sundown!”

“The princess is too much of a fragile flower,” Shiori mutters. “The princess is slowing the commoner down.”

“The princess was DRAGGED INTO THIS FOREST by the commoner girl!”

“The princess had every right to refuse! It’s a free country!” 

“Are you for real right now? It’s a monarchy, you moron!” 

“She’s the princess, YOU moron!”

“D-don’t call me a moron!” 

Oof. That sounded a little too wail-y for my comfort. I really need to stay out of the kitchen if I can’t handle it… Shiori looks a little sorry, but she’s got that look in her eye that says ‘Seriously? Seriously? You just called me one.’

Yorick is shivering in a little corner like both his parents are about to get a divorce. Man... What’s wrong with me? We’re both silent for a while. 

“Um, I’m sorry. I said some mean things. And I know sometimes I’m a real bitch about not being able to take what I dish out.”

“... it’s okay,” Shiori mumbles, sitting down, and trying to comfort the frazzled Yorick.  I’m starting to realize how much she hates fighting. “The two of us are stressed. We’ve been stuck here a long time.” 

“Isn’t there another way to get through here?”

“There’s always multiple ways through a magi’s vault,” Shiori says, her voice getting a little more confident. “Perhaps, you are right. We can’t redo this story unless one of the characters dies. It may be better to take another approach.”

“But um, how do we find our way back?”

“Don’t worry,” Shiori grins. “Like I always say, every story has a trick or two to teach. To make sure we won’t get lost, I’ve been leaving bread crumbs that we can follow back. Guess where that one’s from?”

Um. Hold it in. Don’t say anything.

“Anyway, it should be easy to… oh… oops,” she halts.

“Is there a problem…?” I ask.

“I think a stray vannaknoe was following us and ate the crumbs…”  

“I believe I’ve made a mistake!” I bury my face in my hands.

There it was. 
That fear that haunts hearts,
of both children and grown-ups.
The fear that in friendship, 
just as in the rest of the world, 
there is no such thing as equal.

It nestled in a small corner of her heart,
like termites planning their great feast.
Because the worst fears infest your heart,
and back then, there wasn’t Spray Away.


It was quiet, 
and that’s what makes it scary
to the keen observer.

The days passed happily,
as the princess learned of new worlds.
There were dragons here, 
and there were little bugs there!
Little bugs called parasites,
that did quite nasty things if 
you let them into your body.

Truthfully, the princess was not always
happy to hear about parasites!
But it healed her soul to listen
to her best friend talk.
Even if it was about things laying eggs
in places they really shouldn’t be laying eggs.

If only time could stay still here, 
it would be the happiest of endings.
But we all know time never does that.
Not unless it’s broken. 
And if time starts staying still,
that’s actually a bigger problem.

One day, as the clock 
was moving forward a little too slow,
and the princess was sneaking through the hallway,
a little too slow herself,
the queen, her stepmother, stopped her.
“Just where are you going, my daughter?”
she demanded.
The princess was only ever her daughter
when she was angry, you see.
“I’m furthering my princess education!” 
the princess said, which was a mistake,
because it was already a little too articulate,
for the queen’s tastes.

“Goodness! This smart little girl,” 
the queen said snidely. “My daughter,
perhaps you’re clever enough to know!
There have been rats infesting this castle lately.
Little rats that know too much,
and that think too much as well.
Have you heard their squeaks?
They sound quite craven,
especially when they starve to death,
on sticky resin.
Oh, you’d know if you heard them,
so be on your way,” and she smiled, 
saying nothing else.

And because the princess was no fool, 
she knew.
That morning, as she waited for her best friend, 
she thought that her heart would stop,
for fear her friend would be caught.
When she finally came, the princess hugged her, 
and said: “Please! You have to leave!”
There was no time to explain, 
except for sparse words.
“My mother! It’s my mother! 
Please! She’ll hurt you! 
She’ll kill you! 
Please, just never come here again,” she begged,
to her bewildered friend, 
who had barely gotten in a hello.

And because she was panicking, 
she sent her friend past the gate,
when no one was looking,
and never gave her a real goodbye.

That’s it? This one… really stings, actually. I don’t have any words. 

The worst part about it is that the door opens. As if there was something valuable about that crummy ending. Of course the two of us aren’t saying anything. There’s nothing to say, because it’s just gonna drown in the bitter gloom that follows a stupid sad story.

It’s a full-on stroke of luck that she’s holding Yorick right now, because Shiori is taking the ending really badly. I mean, legit, I am too. Even for sensitive me, this is a new one for how much a piece of fiction leaves a bad taste in my heart. But I guess it makes sense for who Shiori is that it would hit her even worse.

“Shiori… are you okay?” 

“Huh?” she’s startled, even though I’ve been right next to her for a while now. She’s hugging Yorick to herself, and Yorick’s sweetly cuddling against her chin. “I’m… sorry. It reminds me of something. And really, if anyone should be… no, no. Nevermind. Forget that. Um, are you okay?” 

“I’m okay. I’m okay right now.” 

Even though I’m really bad with touch, I don’t feel so strange hugging her right now. I want her to be okay. And I don’t miss a little bit of sniffling on her end. 

“Well… well! We’ve finally reached the cellar! It’s been such an odyssey, hasn’t it?” she trumpets up whatever little bravado she has. “Are you ready?”

Yeah. I’m ready. Let’s go and leave this place together.

The Queen is her true mother AA2

The princess remembered days of warmth,
when her mother had not been so strict. 
But of course, the princess had not been so old.
Never, now, did the queen and her servants,
who were here eyes and ears,
never did they fail to say:
You should know better!
But the princess, sadly, did know better.
But knowing better does not
always mean doing better.
And somehow, no one ever mentioned that.








One day the princess found herself faint,
dizzy and sick,
yearning for her mother’s kindness. 
She hated to bother mother, 
for mother had better things to do, 
than deal with a gloomy child.
But that day, she’d paced all over,
and her feet began to ache.
Then she read books, 
until her eyes began to ache.
And then because she’d held it in so long, 
and her eyes were hurting anyway,
she cried, because she realized her heart 
had been aching for a very long time.

“Oh, but one day just like me,
you’ll have to debut, won’t you?
Will you smile for me then?
Even if it isn’t easy?
Just as I smile for you now,
even when it isn’t easy,” said the queen. 

“Of course, mother. 
I’ll always smile for you,” the princess said,
though she wasn’t smiling inside,
as the words her mother just said,
didn’t feel quite right.


And so it came to be, 
that one day the little princess
was not so little anymore. 
She had debuted in high society, 
and she was of marriageable age.



Many courageous men and women,
have tried, tried, tried again.
But our princess could only
wait, wait, wait and see. 
Finally, the day of betrothment came, 
and she did as any sane girl would…

“She poisoned him,” Shiori says.

“Right, the princess poisoned the duke. I don’t know. Should she? Wait, did he do anything wrong?” I agree with her, but I don’t. But maybe I do.

“You want to poison the entire kingdom instead? That seems immensely more difficult. Rather, it’s his head or hers.” 

“Hold your apothecary, Locusta. We can just run away. It’s simple and clean.”

“We can’t. The whole frickin’ kingdom hates her! ‘Ohh, look at the mean princess who does bad things like keeping to herself and bothering no one!’ They barely need an excuse to screw her over. You think they’ll let her run away?”

“Hey genius, how would poisoning someone make that situation any better?”

“She should at least get something out of it!”

“The prince isn’t even involved! He’s literally the one guy not messing with her!”

“Then let’s poison the whole kingdom! Actually! Actually! I do believe we should do that! If we’re gonna poison anyone, let’s just poison everyone.” 

This is really stupid but, I’m starting to think that poisoning everyone is a good idea. The princess should…

Unironically poison the entire kingdom because why not? GO TO: The princess tries poison DDD1

It is little wonder,
that with such hasty prep,
her plans would go awry.
For a young and lazy page sneaking away from training,
poured himself a cool drink and drank his last.
And what the cooks saw, 
the maids made sure to tell.
And what the maids told,
grew more fascinating by the day.
By the end, it was not mere poison but black magic!





Not that it would have made much difference,
for anyone who drank that water.
Indeed, all that mattered was the type of stain it left,
for bloodthirsty usurpation was normal decorum,
but black magic was disgusting and repulsive.

The court was in a frenzy. 
“Who would sabotage this blessed union?!”
Foreign spies? Fearful nobility? Jealous family?
Then the queen herself stood up and said, with fitful tears,
“I saw my daughter enter the kitchen that night.
I failed as a mother.
I am so sorry my kingdom, my daughter, my darling.”

And the princess’s heart ached like never before,
because her mother was the one person she never
ever wanted to hurt.
That was how she knew she deserved her fate,
and found her proper standing in this court on the scaffold.

“Well, that sucked. If it were me, I would’ve succeeded,” Shiori pouts. “I’m good at sneaking into the kitchen. Though, hmm~, I suppose I’m usually stealing things rather than poisoning things.”

“Gotta say, though, we probably deserved that one.” I sigh, noticing the locked door doesn’t budge. “Guess we gotta try again? I want to… I want to go back to the queen question. The choice about what she was like.”

Was this what freedom was like?
Could she have done this any time she wanted?
For the first day, till nightfall, she wondered
why she had never done something so wonderful.
But as the night cooled down, and she felt her toes freeze,
it was not much of a wonder anymore.

The newly rash are never as good at winging it,
as the compulsively impulsive.
No money, no thick clothes, and not even shoes,
nor anything to identify her as royalty.
How could she even ask to impose on the commoners?
They did not like her. And she had done nothing for them.
She had done nothing to them, of course.
But that didn’t help her much.
That night, she huddled on a hill, as winter made itself known.

Ahem.

“O-okay, that one was pretty sad,” I say, clearing my throat. “Cheap and effective. Classic kid’s story move.”

Shiori isn’t holding it in nearly as well. Evidently a sucker for just this kind of story, and she’s sniffling a bit. 

“Oh c’mon! They used every trick in the book there!” I say. 

“Yeah, but it’s still kinda sad!” Shiori says, wiping her eyes. “But that didn’t open the door! So, we gotta go back anyway!”

“Yeah, I know, I know. Um,  I want to… I want to go back to the queen question. The choice about what she was like.”

“You know, my little one?
This castle seemed so big back then.
I’m sure that’s how it must be for you.
With your little feet, 
and your little hands.”
The queen and princess giggled together.
Wasn’t it like this every day, once upon a time?

“When I came to this place, 
I was the daughter of a viscount,
and goodness! No one, no one at all,
had a nice word to say to me.


If I spoke too loud, 
they’d call me poor-bred! 
If I sat too still,
they’d spread rumors that I could hardly walk!
Oh, my princess, sometimes I forget, 
what you must be living through right now.”

That’s okay,
the princess thought half-asleep, 
forgetting she’d even interrupted, 
her mother’s social gathering.
She simply dozed off,
in her mother’s arms, 
as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

It was a days she’d hold in her heart,
for so very, very long.
Because sunny days followed,
but good things don’t always happen on sunny days.
On one sunny day, the princess interrupted a meeting.
And the queen was so flustered and flabbergasted,
the princess did not hear the end of it, 
for a full two hours.

And on another sunny day,
the princess broke a vase,
and stunningly, the queen said not a word.
She just became deathly quiet.
Which was much, much scarier.

But sometimes on rainy days,
when business was adjourned, 
and the people of the court,
were too lazy to run kingdoms,
the princess would find herself once again,
on her mother’s lap,
happily hearing of just how, how much
the two of them were the same.

Did you know?
Once the queen herself broke a vase,
and the old baroness, that was the queen’s mother,
used to spank her with a wooden spoon!
The princess put her hands to her mouth,
and gasped a prayer of gratitude.
Thank goodness the queen had never done that to her!

The courtly days idled on,
as did the princess herself,
always looking forward to those days, 
when she could sit on her mother’s lap.

And one day, the queen asked the princess:
“My darling, have you come to know,
how much the two of us are alike?”


“I have, mother!” the princess said, 
telling the absolute truth. 
“You were just a girl like me once,”
the princess giggled,
hardly believing the thought.

“Would you believe we all were, once, darling?
That old croon the baroness, 
who never seems to croak,” she chuckled,
“and every woman and old woman who ever lived,
were just young girls like you.”
‘Of course mother,’ the princess thought.
‘Isn’t that too obvious?’
Some truths, you see, are easier to know
than they are to understand.
So the princess did not quite grasp
this little wisdom all men and women
eventually come to understand.

“I’d like us to be like each other, 
even more,” the queen said.
And the queen lovingly pulled out an apple.

“This apple here, you see, it’s very special.
Because this apple, and I cannot tell you how,
this apple made me fit to be a queen.
I ate it when I was a little girl.
A girl who looked just like you do now,” 
the queen said, touching the princess’s nose,
and bringing out a small giggle.



But. 
The apple was scary.
The sight of it gave the princess fits.
But it looked just like a normal apple!
“O-of course mother, I will,” the princess stuttered,
because she could think of no good reason
to hurt her mother.
“But I shall do it tomorrow! 
When morning comes,
I’ll eat it,
because right now I am nervous.
Y-you understand. Right mother?”
And the queen said nothing,
but kept her serene smile.




But the worm told her to shush,
to hush her mouth,
because it was sleeping just out of sight.
“Do you want to know, you nitwit?
What my home is made of?”
No, not particularly,
thought the princess,
who just wanted to wake up.
“You nitwit! I’m asking, do you want to know,
your mother’s thoughts! The queen’s dreams!
Your mommy’s feelings! The apple’s core,
this castle’s throne! Would you like to know?!”




Of course! Of course she wanted to know!
The princess was angry for the first time in her life.
Of course she wanted to know how her mother felt.
She thought about it every day.
She wanted to know so much,
she was ready to fight with this miserable worm,
squirming at the corner of her eye.

And…

The princess couldn’t help herself, and shouted yes! She’d love to know. She needs to know.

“...uh?” I flip the page back and forth, and turn the book around a few times. “Is this missing a page?”

“Good god, I hate these types of endings,” Shiori growls. 

But the door opens, anyway. I actually feel relieved, for some crazy reason that I can’t even fully guess at. I really wanted to know what the worm had to say, but I didn’t, you know? Feeling a little dissatisfied… I mean, graces, that’s most fiction. It’s hard to write a good ending.

I have a feeling that there was a feeling much scarier waiting on the other side.

The other side of the loop, however, is not scary at all. Though it’s a little weird. Last time our funny surprise at the end of the loop was a locked door. This time? Nothing. Just an empty wall. I’ve got an anticipatory headache for whatever new search and destroy we’ll have to do, but the relief in my chest is telling me it’s better than knowing whatever the snake was going to say.

Shiori, for her part, is as clueless as me for once.
“I’m not actually sure what pattern’s going on right now,” she says thoughtfully. “Let’s just look through the books and see what comes up.”

That’s when I see it. “The Secrets of Shiori Novella.” She sees it right after me, and somehow boldly walks right up to it. She’s got this smug look to her, actually. 

“Such a thing would never bother me,” she shrugs and lets off all kinds of hot air. “I aspire to be an open book, just like those I read. I keep no painful sec—- hey!” 

I snatch it from her before she overheats. 

“‘Today, I left a microphone in Nerissa’s room to record her while she sleeps.’ Wow. That is actually really gross, but not quite  as bad as I was expecting.

“...Like I said! I have nothing I feel like I need to hide!”

“‘Yesterday, I licked Bijou because I wondered if different emotions taste different. Then I blamed it on Mococo. The two of them are fighting, and I feel so, so guilty. I’m too scared to bring it up.’”

“I should… probably resolve that one, yes. Okay, I have one thing to hide.”

“Recently, I have been surfing the web to see if there’s a cage big enough to keep both Fuwawa and Mococo… but I still have not solved the bathroom prob… are you serious? What’s wrong with you?”

“N-no! It sounds weirder than it is! They’re dogs! And we’ve all been in jail anyway, so they’d be used to it!” 

I surreptitiously make a little more distance between me and her, and shake my head. I should stop reading her weird secrets because I think it’s giving Yorick some heartache too. I’m not quite sure where his heart would be.


But a thought flashes across my mind.

At the very same time as an awful, gut-wrenching feeling.

The thought that I’ve been missing… maybe even dancing around… something very, incredibly obvious. The feeling that all that dancing’s because of something painful, that I still don’t want to know. I’m too scared to know. 

Just for a second, though, I remember. Not the thing itself. I just remember how scared I am. 

That’s why I can’t help it. Not with the new me who’s tired of running away from things. There’s a book on the shelf that’s calling for me, loudly, screaming at me all of a sudden. And I’m scared of it. Looking at it is actually making me clench up, like my limbs are giving me a veto on walking over.

I can’t stop, though. Because I’m more scared of letting fear stop me for the rest of my life.

“Hm? W-wait! Don’t touch that! You’re not ready!”

I grab it before she can do anything, and rip it open.

“Today a girl my age
came to the village.
I was mean to her,
but I actually  wanted to be her friend.
Her name was Shiori.

No, this was surely wrong.
This wasn’t how love worked.
This isn’t how trust works.
She simply shook her head adamantly,
gazing firmly even while the worm snickered.

“To each their own,
you little nitwit!
Different strokes for different folks,
and one woman’s apple 
can always be a little girl’s poison!”

But the princess refused to budge.
How would she ever
look her mother in the eye,
if she cowardly eavesdropped
on her very feelings?

“I’m like my mother,” 
the princess said with confidence.
“And she’d never stoop so low. 
So neither will I!”

And she woke up slowly, 
fretfully, the worm giggling all the while,
as she came back to our realm.
“I have to go eat the apple,” 
the princess said solemnly.
“I have to show mother that I’m just like her.”

She jumped out of bed,
and raced all the way to the entertaining room, 
where she’d so often sat in her mother’s lap.
And she’d do so today! Maybe! 



Oh, goodness, the princess never asked,
if becoming queenly meant she’d be too old for that!
Now she was nervous,
but promises were promises, 
and surely even queenly girls still sometimes,
spent childish times with their mother.


The queen was there, as promised, 
as was that scary apple.
Perhaps it was scary like responsibility,
and the fear she felt right this moment,
was the fear of obligation.


Maybe she’ll grow up from childhood,
just right now,
once she takes a bite.




Nibble, nibble, nibble. 
A good three nibbles to show her mom,
just how serious she was.
The apple really did taste sweet.
What was she so scared of?
And she really did feel sleepy,
but in a good way, 
just like her mother said she would.

“Mother… when I’m regal and queenly,
can I still lay here, on your lap, just like this?”
the princess asked weakly, sleep taking over.
“Of course, my love. Even when you’re an old woman,
mommy will always give you her lap.”
Of course, thought the princess.
Because she’s just like me,
And when mother’s too old…
I’ll let her lay in my lap, too.
A few sweet words, 
just three beautiful ones, 
failed to leave the princess’s lips.
She tried to whisper them,
but she was just too sleepy.
That was okay, though.
She’d tell her when she woke up.

And as the princess drifted off 
to an endless sleep,
her final moments,
if it’s any consolation to the reader, 
were happy.

“W-what?” I stutter out. 

“What a crummy ending,” Shiori says, angrily stomping her foot. “I feel like I just lost a year of my life. Ugh! This is the part where I’m supposed to go ‘ohhhh, what a wonderful story!’ Blegh!” 

“Yeah… what a dumb story,” I breathe out hard. “I really hate it when they end like that. Some stupid lame ambiguous ending! Don’t write if you can’t even come up with an ending, right?”
Shiori stops dead in her tracks, and looks back. She’s worrying about me. Her mouth’s halfway opening a little dumbly, like a fish trying to talk. But she closes it and doesn’t say anything. Just looks like she’s a bit anguished.

“I don’t get it. Seriously, I’m lost. I guess I didn’t understand it at all.” I say, not really to anyone at all. “Why bother having dumb rules if you’re just gonna break them?”

“...yes, you’re right. I don’t understand it, either. ” Shiori says. 

“We wrote in that she loved her, right? It has to follow that, right? I don’t get it! Did she love her or not? The ending should make it clear!”

“It… should have. It was a bad ending. It truly was.”

“I-I’m not getting angry at you.”

“I know you aren’t. You’re okay.”

“Yeah… that’s it. I’m done now. Got it all off my chest. Just needed to vent for a sec.”

The door opens up, right then, which means we found our way to the cellar, thank goodness. That means we won’t need this stupid book anymore. In fact.

“Umm, hold Yorick for a moment…” I hand him off carefully to Shiori. Then I grab the vannaknoe that had ‘The Princess’s Tale’ and throw it hard to the ground, giving it a few good stomps with as much as my admittedly small body can manage.

Then I start kicking it.

I’m kicking as hard as I can, and I think I actually sprained my ankle now.

Shiori dives in unexpectedly to grab the vannaknoe, and rolls and scuttles a bit to the side. I stop a kick midflight, and figure out I definitely sprained my ankle. I’m just looking at her perplexed, breathing hard, but now that I’m here breathing this hard I don’t know if I’m perplexed by her or me.

“These things are gross little creatures… but they’re still creatures. The um, glue would’ve worn off,” she says, keeping her tone as neutral as possible. Like she’s walking on eggshells around me. Somehow that’s so very, very distressing. “It’s okay. You’re okay. You didn’t really know.” 

“I’m sorry…” 

“I know you’d never hurt anything if…” she pauses, knowing there’s no polite way to say it. “... if you were in your right mind, you know.”

“I don’t know where this is coming from,” I say, realizing my eyes are blurring just a little bit. “This is so stupid. I feel so stupid right now.”

“It’s not stupid. Here. Here, come on. Yorick’s sad and wants to comfort you, okay? Hold him.”

Yorick’s so sweet. All I can do is sit down dumbly and hold him close to me. Honestly, every emotion I’ve ever had worth admiring was probably centered around protecting this thing. Ugh. The blurriness in my eyes is getting a lot worse. And I hear a really ugly noise come out of the back of my throat. Oh, please no. I don’t think Yorick wants a snot shower right now.

But as I’m holding the little thing, I keep thinking about the princess in her mom’s lap. I can’t understand it. Why didn’t she love her?

Weren’t they supposed to be the same?

Didn’t we write it into the story? 

How hard is it to hold someone? You just… ugh! It’s so easy. It’s the easiest thing in the world. Doesn’t it feel good? Shouldn’t it feel good to hold your daughter? It makes me happy to hold this little blob, right? Is it that hard to hold your kid? 

It hurts. It just really hurts. It hurts so much, and I can’t stop myself from crying.

“She wasn’t some stepmom, right?!”

“No…”

“And they were supposed to be just like each other, right?!”

“Yes. They were…” Shiori pulls me into a soft hug.

“I-I don’t g-get it!” I get out between little sobs and hiccups. “What’s she want? What’s she thinking? Why would she hurt her?! The story said she loved her!”

I’m crying into Shiori’s shoulder by now, and she’s just softly rubbing my back while Yorick nuzzles against my neck. It feels nice, the way she gently pulls my hair to the side so I stop crying into it. I can feel myself calming down a bit, hear my shuddering breaths stop shaking like crazy. For a while she doesn’t say anything. It’s just me, letting out those tiny, shuddering squeaks. Until slowly, slowly, it quiets down…

“Sometimes people are just…” Shiori sighs. “...they’re like Yon-shi. You remember Yon-shi?” 

“...mmhm. Yeah.” Muffle muffle.

“You can’t even trust his secrets. Not even their bare soul. The queen was just one of those people, you know?”

“The princess…hic.  Didn’t do anything, though.” Muffle muffle.

“Of course not. She never did anything. She was an angel. Always was.”

“Then… why?”

“Because… the queen was just a bad person. That’s all. That’s the simple, sad truth.” Shiori hugs me a little tighter. And that last truth gets me crying again. For a little long while. Even though there’s nothing left to say.

The Cellar Entrance ZZZ
All of a sudden, we’re here. My head feels like someone hit it with a hammer. My eyes are red and my nose is runny, and I don’t remember why. And I feel like Shiori and I have been fighting and making up for about three hours, somehow at the same time. It’s like someone gathered up every single emotion in me and made a really, really awful burrito, and didn’t microwave it long enough. 

So, I do actually throw up. I’ve been teasing that one up for a while now, the puking. I hope it lived up to the hype.

“What’s wrong with me?” I say woozily. “What were we even doing?”

Shiori doesn’t look so hot herself. “Well, from our perspective we only went through one path… but, in truth, our souls sort of went on every single path at once and converged right here. Er – actually, looks like some of them are still wandering.” 

“What are they doing?!”

“What are we doing, you mean? I don’t know.”

“Well, we over there need to get it together.”

“Are you just figuring that out now?” Shiori giggles a little tiredly. “Let’s just hope they don’t take too long. We’ll have to go on, anyway, and maybe they’ll catch up in a couple of hours… or… years.”

“YEARS?! I’m gonna only be partial-soul for years?”

“Ohhh, it’s not as bad as it sounds, you know. About a third of your soul’s there more for margin and cushion. Like junk DNA! At any rate, are you ready?”

“...I-I think so, yeah.”

“Well! Well, well, let’s try and bring this adventure to a close then, shall we?” And she trots forward, trying to fake her usual bravado. But I can tell she’s tired.

No… I know by now. I can feel it with my beating heart. She’s anxious too, the closer we get to the end, and it’s not like I don’t know why. I want to ask her the obvious question. And I almost do, before she liltingly pulls away, almost like she heard the question get stuck in my throat. 
 
“Who am I?” I whisper, mostly to myself.
