                <p>The princess remembered days of warmth,
                    when her mother had not been so strict.  <br>
                    But of course, the princess had not been so old.
                    Never, now, did the queen and her servants, <br>
                    who were here eyes and ears,
                    never did they fail to say: <br>
                    You should know better!
                    But the princess, sadly, did know better. <br>
                    But knowing better does not
                    always mean doing better. <br>
                    And somehow, no one ever mentioned that.</p>
            
                    <img src="image15.png" alt="">

                    <p>One day the princess found herself faint,
                        dizzy and sick, <br>
                        yearning for her mother’s kindness. 
                        She hated to bother mother,  <br>
                        for mother had better things to do, 
                        than deal with a gloomy child. <br>
                        But that day, she’d paced all over,
                        and her feet began to ache. <br>
                        Then she read books, 
                        until her eyes began to ache. <br>
                        And then because she’d held it in so long, 
                        and her eyes were hurting anyway, <br>
                        she cried, because she realized her heart 
                        had been aching for a very long time. <br>
                        </p>
