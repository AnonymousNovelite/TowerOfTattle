                <p>It is little wonder,
                    that with such hasty prep, <br>
                    her plans would go awry.
                    For a young and lazy page sneaking away from training, <br>
                    poured himself a cool drink and drank his last.
                    And what the cooks saw,  <br>
                    the maids made sure to tell.
                    And what the maids told, <br>
                    grew more fascinating by the day.
                    By the end, it was not mere poison but black magic! <br><br>
                    Not that it would have made much difference,
                    for anyone who drank that water. <br>
                    Indeed, all that mattered was the type of stain it left,
                    for bloodthirsty usurpation was normal decorum,
                    but black magic was disgusting and repulsive. <br><br>
                    The court was in a frenzy. 
                    “Who would sabotage this blessed union?!”<br>
                    Foreign spies? Fearful nobility? Jealous family?
                    Then the queen herself stood up and said, with fitful tears, <br>
                    “I saw my daughter enter the kitchen that night.
                    I failed as a mother. 
                    I am so sorry my kingdom, my daughter, my darling.” <br><br>
                And the princess’s heart ached like never before,
                because her mother was the one person she never <br>
                ever wanted to hurt.
                That was how she knew she deserved her fate, <br>
                and found her proper standing in this court on the scaffold.

                <p>“Well, that sucked. If it were me, I would’ve succeeded,” Shiori pouts. “I’m good at sneaking into the kitchen. Though, hmm~, I suppose I’m usually stealing things rather than poisoning things.”
                
                    </p>
                
                    <p>    “We probably deserved that one.” I sigh, noticing the locked door doesn’t budge. “Guess we gotta try again? I want to… I want to go back to the queen question. The choice about what she was like.”</p>
