                <p>“Hey, hey, have you read that story?” 
                    “W-what story are you talking about?”
                    “You know, it’s called The Princess’s Tale, you know, <br>
                    and it’s about a princess like you, 
                    who meets a girl like me!  <br>
                    And then the girl comes up to the princess and asks,
                    ‘Hey, hey, have you read that story?’ <br>
                    Then the princess asks, ‘W-what story are you talking about?’ <br>
                    And then…”

                    <p>She trembled behind the shelf,
                        holding her mouth, so she wouldn’t scream. <br>
                        “She’s gonna kill me… goodness, she’s gonna kill me!”
                        ‘Is she going to kill my stepmother, too?’ the princess  wondered. <br>
                        “I’m not sure how bad I’d feel…”
                        “I FOUND YOU!” <br>
                        “EEEEEEK!”
                        “Very clever hiding behind the shelf, princess!  <br>
                        You know if you push the shelf to the side,
                        you can find a whole new library,  and a whole new set of shelves! <br>
                        Then you can hide behind those!
                        Shelves within shelves, interlinked! Say it!” <br>
                        “Shelves within shelves, interlinked,” the princess gasped.
                        “Interlinked! <br>
                        “I-i-interw-w-winked!” the princess bit her tongue. 
                        “Uh oh princess…” the girl said, approaching. <br>
                        </p>

                Welp. Shiori has been totally silent for about twenty minutes now. Just quietly sitting in a corner, petting Yorick, and very occasionally throwing a glare my way. Okay, okay. I get it. This one’s on me.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                “I didn’t write it, okay? That’s not you. You’re not like that.”
                
            </p>
            
            <p>She just turns away. Looks like it’s gonna be a sulkfest for a lot, lot longer. I double facepalm in frustration. Ugh. I really need to stop doing this. But I don’t have Yorick to pet anymore… Okay! Enough of that! We need to power through. Let’s pick a new route.

                It looks like Shiori is sulking. But fret not! That doesn’t mean you can’t choose which story you want to jump right into. </p>
