                    <p>‚ÄúYou know, my little one?
                        This castle seemed so big back then. <br>
                        I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs how it must be for you.
                        With your little feet,  <br>
                        and your little hands.‚Äù
                        The queen and princess giggled together. <br>
                        Wasn‚Äôt it like this every day, once upon a time? <br><br>
                        
                        ‚ÄúWhen I came to this place, 
                        I was the daughter of a viscount, <br>
                        and goodness! No one, no one at all,
                        had a nice word to say to me. <br> <br>
                        
                        
                        If I spoke too loud, 
                        they‚Äôd call me poor-bred!  <br>
                        If I sat too still,
                        they‚Äôd spread rumors that I could hardly walk! <br>
                        Oh, my princess, sometimes I forget, 
                        what you must be living through right now.‚Äù <br> <br>
                        
                        That‚Äôs okay,
                        the princess thought half-asleep,  <br>
                        forgetting she‚Äôd even interrupted, 
                        her mother‚Äôs social gathering. <br>
                        She simply dozed off,
                        in her mother‚Äôs arms,  <br>
                        as if it were the most natural thing in the world. <br> <br>
                        
                        It was a days she‚Äôd hold in her heart,
                        for so very, very long. <br>
                        Because sunny days followed,
                        but good things don‚Äôt always happen on sunny days. <br>
                        On one sunny day, the princess interrupted a meeting.
                        And the queen was so flustered and flabbergasted,
                        the princess did not hear the end of it,  <br>
                        for a full two hours. <br>
                        
                        And on another sunny day,
                        the princess broke a vase, <br>
                        and stunningly, the queen said not a word.
                        She just became deathly quiet. <br>
                        Which was much, much scarier.
                        
                        But sometimes on rainy days, <br>
                        when business was adjourned, 
                        and the people of the court, <br>
                        were too lazy to run kingdoms,
                        the princess would find herself once again, <br>
                        on her mother‚Äôs lap,
                        happily hearing of just how, how much <br>
                        the two of them were the same.
                        
                        Did you know?
                        Once the queen herself broke a vase, <br>
                        and the old baroness, that was the queen‚Äôs mother,
                        used to spank her with a wooden spoon! <br>
                        The princess put her hands to her mouth,
                        and gasped a prayer of gratitude. <br>
                        Thank goodness the queen had never done that to her! <br> <br>
                        
                        The courtly days idled on,
                        as did the princess herself, <br>
                        always looking forward to those days, 
                        when she could sit on her mother‚Äôs lap. <br> <br>
                        
                        And one day, the queen asked the princess:
                        ‚ÄúMy darling, have you come to know, <br>
                        how much the two of us are alike?‚Äù <br> <br>
                        
                        
                        ‚ÄúI have, mother!‚Äù the princess said, 
                        telling the absolute truth.  <br>
                        ‚ÄúYou were just a girl like me once,‚Äù
                        the princess giggled, <br>
                        hardly believing the thought. <br> <br>
                        
                        ‚ÄúWould you believe we all were, once, darling?
                        That old croon the baroness,  <br>
                        who never seems to croak,‚Äù she chuckled,
                        ‚Äúand every woman and old woman who ever lived, <br>
                        were just young girls like you.‚Äù 
                        ‚ÄòOf course mother,‚Äô the princess thought. <br>
                        ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt that too obvious?‚Äô
                        Some truths, you see, are easier to know <br>
                        than they are to understand.
                        So the princess did not quite grasp <br>
                        this little wisdom all men and women
                        eventually come to understand. <br> <br>
                        
                        ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like us to be like each other, 
                        even more,‚Äù the queen said. <br>
                        And the queen lovingly pulled out an apple. <br><br>
                        
                        ‚ÄúThis apple here, you see, it‚Äôs very special.
                        Because this apple, and I cannot tell you how, <br>
                        this apple made me fit to be a queen.
                        I ate it when I was a little girl. <br>
                        A girl who looked just like you do now,‚Äù 
                        the queen said, touching the princess‚Äôs nose, <br>
                        and bringing out a small giggle.
                        </p>
                
                        <img src="image8.png" alt="">
                
                        <p>But. 
                            The apple was scary. <br>
                            The sight of it gave the princess fits.
                            But it looked just like a normal apple! <br>
                            ‚ÄúO-of course mother, I will,‚Äù the princess stuttered,
                            because she could think of no good reason <br>
                            to hurt her mother.
                            ‚ÄúBut I shall do it tomorrow!  <br>
                            When morning comes,
                            I‚Äôll eat it, <br>
                            because right now I am nervous.
                            Y-you understand. Right mother?‚Äù <br>
                            And the queen said nothing,
                            but kept her serene smile.
                            </p>
                
                            <img src="image12.png" alt="">
                
                            <p>But the worm told her to shush,
                                to hush her mouth, <br>
                                because it was sleeping just out of sight.
                                ‚ÄúDo you want to know, you nitwit? <br>
                                What my home is made of?‚Äù
                                No, not particularly, <br>
                                thought the princess,
                                who just wanted to wake up. <br>
                                ‚ÄúYou nitwit! I‚Äôm asking, do you want to know,
                                your mother‚Äôs thoughts! The queen‚Äôs dreams! <br>
                                Your mommy‚Äôs feelings! The apple‚Äôs core,
                                this castle‚Äôs throne! Would you like to know?!‚Äù <br><br>
                
                                Of course! Of course she wanted to know!
                                The princess was angry for the first time in her life. <br>
                                Of course she wanted to know how her mother felt.
                                She thought about it every day. <br>
                                She wanted to know so much,
                                she was ready to fight with this miserable worm, <br>
                                squirming at the corner of her eye.
                                
                                And‚Ä¶
