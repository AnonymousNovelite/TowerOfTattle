        Was this what freedom was like?
Could she have done this any time she wanted? <br>
For the first day, till nightfall, she wondered
why she had never done something so wonderful. <br>
But as the night cooled down, and she felt her toes freeze,
it was not much of a wonder anymore. <br><br>

The newly rash are never as good at winging it,
as the compulsively impulsive. <br>
No money, no thick clothes, and not even shoes,
nor anything to identify her as royalty. <br>
How could she even ask to impose on the commoners?
They did not like her. And she had done nothing for them. <br>
She had done nothing to them, of course.
But that didn’t help her much. <br>
That night, she huddled on a hill, as winter made itself known.

                “O-okay, that one was pretty sad,” I say, clearing my throat. “Cheap and effective. Classic kid’s story move.”

                Shiori isn’t holding it in nearly as well. Evidently a sucker for just this kind of story, and she’s sniffling a bit.

                “Oh c’mon! They used every trick in the book there!” I say. 
    
</p>            
<p>
                “Yeah, but it’s still kinda sad!” Shiori says, wiping her eyes. “But that didn’t open the door! So, we gotta go back anyway!”
    
</p>            
<p>
                “Yeah, I know, I know. Um,  I want to… I want to go back to the queen question. The choice about what she was like.”
