            And he ousted the stepmother from her queendom, <br>
            for the prince came from The Empire,
            and as we all know, Empires are bigger than Kingdoms. <br>
            “The Empire?!” the nobles cried. 
            “Yes, The Empire!” the crown prince cried. <br>
            “Behold my raven hair, which only Empire Royalty has!” he cried again. <br>
            “We never noticed! How?!” the nobles cried in response.

        I don’t know how long I’ve been down here.

        I don’t know how many times the prince has called the princess ‘interesting’ with an amused smile.
