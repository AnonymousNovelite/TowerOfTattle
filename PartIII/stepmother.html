                        tending to the kingdom’s affairs.
                        By noon, she scurried to the training grounds,<br>
                        where the sun glared harshly on metal
                        from knights testing their mettle, <br>
                        for her stepmother was by the cool trees
                        in the courtyard, enjoying their fruits and shade.

                    <p class="actualQuote">The princess was in one sense quite social, 
                        some might say a real butterfly,
                        because who else was friends with so many?<br>
                        The lamps in the library.
                        The soup stocks in the pantry. <br>
                        The linens in the closet. 
                        And occasionally, the ants on the ground.  <br>
                        She had many friends. 
                        But she was about to meet <br>
                        her first human one.
                        <br>
                        On a day that was windier than windy, 
                        she met that person she’d secretly hoped for, <br>
                        a kind of person, really.
                        Beggars can’t be choosers,  <br>
                        but dreamers can be dreamers.
                        And for dreamers, only someone <br>
                        like out of a dream,
                        could suffice.
                        <br>
                        On that windy, windy day, 
                        the princess met…

                        “A prince.” It’s a pretty cliched little fairy tale, but whatever. That’s what little girls like, right? It’s cute, but a little too obvious. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “...what?” Shiori asks with her most annoying tone yet.</p>
                    <p>
                        “What do you mean, what?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Why would she want a prince? Are you actually serious right now? Why would you want a prince?” she asks, incredulously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I don’t want a prince, but that’s where the story’s leading. Just look at her!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “She just wants a normal friend her age that’s a girl,” Shiori fumed. “Why do you have to put a prince in everything?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I’m not putting anything in anything. I’m just reading the story properly! ‘Dreamers can’t be dreamers, and for dreamers, only someone out of a dream.’ What else could it mean?” I can’t stop myself from clutching Yorick defensively. I mean, protectively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “So, you’re the type who dreams about princes, huh? I honestly would never have pegged you for that. But I guess the signs were all there…”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Agh! I’m gonna strangle you! I don’t care. Write what you want. Give her a prince. Give her a bff. You’ve got the quill!”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Alright, alright! Hold your horses. Your… shiny, white, prince-carrying stallions, as it were,” she chuckles. “Let’s just say that she…”
