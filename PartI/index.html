        <p>Can I ask you a question?</p>
        <p>
          Do you have any secrets? The kind you'd never spill? Too intimate, too
          embarrassing... Too scary. Too many reasons to never, ever tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Give it some proper thought. Close your eyes for a moment and think
          about the one thing in the world you'd least like to share. No one's
          there to watch you. There's no one reading your mind. Tease the secret
          out of your heart and let it get caught up in your throat like you're
          about to cough up a bit of blood. Swallow it down again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you've got a sore throat. Me too. I've got interminable laryngitis
          from all the secrets I keep locked up inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, it may all be for naught. Out there in the mystical wild,
          there's a tower that records every secret ever had. Whether they were
          far too easily told, or perfectly kept, they're archived there in that
          tower, that library of secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's called The Tower of Tattle. I came up with that one, for what
          it's worth. I had a lot of time to name it, because I was stuck there
          for a very long time. And I hated it there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Down instead of up, it spirals ceaselessly into the ground. It's
          double spired, both spires looping into each other back and forth,
          back and forth, just like an infinity symbol. The shelves that keep
          those secrets ‚Äï yours, mine, and everyone's ‚Äï line its walls all the
          way down.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the secrets are loud. They never, ever shut up. I was sick of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I never even tried to escape. I'd given up before the story even
          started. I was too apathetic, too actually pathetic, to even get
          through the prologue. It didn't matter if it could be done, because I
          was utterly convinced it couldn't be done by me. I was happy to be
          miserable forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          One day, though... One day I opened my eyes. And I saw golden ones
          staring back.

        <p>I'm staring at the ceiling again.</p>
        <p>
          The books are whispering so loudly. Or maybe it's not loud at all.
          Maybe it's just unbearable because they never stop, they've never
          stopped, and they never will stop. Holding a small paperback for a
          long time is easy. But what if you had to carry it forever? Now, it's
          awful torture.

          Today's one of those days where I actually want to cry. But I'm too
          tired to. I was squeezing my eyes shut too long and I don't think
          those overworked tear ducts have it in them to pump any liquid.
        </p>

          For a little bit, this place was fun. Secrets? Absolute page turners.
          I hate to say it, but drinking up other people's mistakes, misgivings,
          and misdemeanors is thrilling.

          "What a dumb brat," I'd laugh. She even sounds like a child, I'd
          snicker.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, I'm not laughing anymore. In fact, right about now the mental
          headache's getting stronger than the physical one. Just gonna plug up
          my ears, scrunch up my eyes and...
        </p>
        <p>Wait forever, I guess.</p>
        <p>"My, my. Is it fine sleeping there?"</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>
          My eyes flash open, expecting to see torchlight, but I'm greeted by
          another kind of warm amber. Those irises... I'm struck. I can't do
          much more than gape dumbly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shiori~n." She smiles at me, raises her index and middle finger at
          me. Not sure what that's supposed to be, but she's dazed and I'm
          dazzling. Wait. Switch those around. I ‚Äï ack! Windpipe!
        </p>
        <p>"Shi...! Shiori...?" I cough out, grimacing.</p>
        <p>
          Before I know it, she's grabbed my hand and pulled me up. She's all
          around me dusting me off. I flinch at her touch before easing in.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. Shiori Novella. Graces, it's all over your blouse you
          frickin' tomboy," she grins. "Though I guess there's no where else to
          lie down around here, huh?"
        </p>
        <p>Somehow it feels like I've been waiting for her forever.</p>
        <p>
          "Um, yeah..." I glance at her and turn away fast. I genuinely don't
          know what I'm feeling right now. But I'm definitely not channeling it
          very well. When I look at her, it's like I m‚Äï
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not very articulate for someone who spends all their time in a
          library, huh?" she says, framing her face with the hand she just held
          up, posing with what's ostensibly meant to be an enigmatic smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...that is super annoying. Ugh. Look, I can't think of anything to
          say, because what I really want to say? Is nuts. I... really m‚Äï
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúI mean, really! You must be so glad to have someone to talk to. I
          can‚Äôt help but ask why you were sleeping so funny. I‚Äôve seen all sorts
          of sleeping postures, but human playing dead possum is a first,‚Äù she
          giggles.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don‚Äôt know what I was just thinking but I‚Äôm not thinking it anymore.
          If I‚Äôm gaping at her it‚Äôs for a completely different reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, do forgive me," now one of her hands is an actual unironic finger
          gun. "I have been known to be too honest at times."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh? Have you?" I snap.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, sometimes someone such as I can be difficult to understand and ‚Äï

        </p>
        <p>"Is this usually how you greet people?"</p>
        <p>"Hm? Eh?"</p>
        <p>
          She flinches. I guess I'm glaring. I don't know what face I'm making
          actually. But we're in a staring contest anyway. She's stuck in her
          dumb pose, faltering grin and all, and I can almost see the panicked
          question marks popping around her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around us, the books keep swishing and scraping along, like cicadas
          punctuating an awkward confession on a lonely summer night.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Too eloquent for me, right? I look too dumb for you, right? Well,
          that suits me just fine," I say. Like a kid who got left too long at
          daycare, all that warmth and relief in my chest starts bubbling up
          into something venomous. The books are gossiping louder than ever and
          my head hurts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ahaha... I have been known to be inscrutable with my jests
          occasionally. Uh? You're not going to ask what I'm doing here? Hey,
          where are you going?"
        </p>
        <p>I've been alone here for a very long time.</p>
        <p>
          So, you might be wondering what's got me acting like the sourest kid
          in the patch. Frankly? I'm just as clueless as you. But her theatrical
          behavior's activating all kinds of chemical reactions in my head and I
          can't handle it. Before I know it, I'm already sauntering away like
          I'm too good for her company.
        </p>
        <p>Her boots plod along the wool carpet.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait, hold up! Are you mad?" The chittering books get louder and
          louder and louder.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would I be?" I quicken my pace. Where the heck is all this heat
          flooding my face coming from?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well you see, I'm usually the one waiting mysteriously in the
          library, so I can provide some experienced... sage, rather, advice.
          See, this is the part where you tilt your head leisurely, and glint
          your eye and say something like 'I suppose even butterflies are drawn
          to nectar ‚Äï'"
        </p>
        <p>"Hey." I stop.</p>
        <p>"Hm?"</p>
        <p>
          "I'm sure you're a great person. But I don't want you to follow me." I
          very consciously don't turn around. I don't want to see her face. But
          I hear her plodding stop, and my heart strains for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>But I keep going. And...</p>
        <p>
          Oh graces. Something's wrong with me. I want her to follow me. Wait,
          am I really this kind of person?
        </p>
        <p>
          My head's screaming at me to stop, but my feet are scheming against me
          and keep moving. Stop! You! Dummy! Why are you so mad?! What are you
          even saying?! Good graces, I AM that kind of person?!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you essentially treating me like... a pest?" I hear her voice,
          much softer than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who knows, Miss Blunt? Am I being too tactful?" Come on. Don't just
          stand there! Follow me! Why are you frozen in place from a little
          surliness?!
        </p>
        <p>
          "... that's a little mean, but I guess you're making a poi - ah wait!
          No!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tower of Tattle shifts spatially where the infinity loops. That is
          to say, at the center, where the two paths cross into one. I'm not
          being metaphorical here. I mean literally, this library is shaped like
          an infinity symbol. It goes on forever. And when you cross the loop...
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bye now," I take a small smiling glance backwards and cross the
          center.
        </p>
        <p>
          The archives shift almost imperceptibly, like a director making the
          perfect match cut. And when I turn around she's gone. We may as well
          be in different worlds now.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how many times you cross the loop, you never reach the same
          place twice. The chances of us ever finding each other again are
          literally zero.
        </p>
        <p>Literally. Zero.</p>
        <p>I will never see her again, for the rest of eternity.</p>
        <p>
          Great work. I completely alienated a nice person in less time than it
          takes to microwave popcorn. And now I'm alone again. Forever. I slump
          back to lie down again and cover my face. What the hell's wrong with
          me?

          They're all in cleverly named anthologies, these secrets. No specific

          incredibly? It's quite a journey?" Shiori nods, but then closes her
          eyes and tilts her head a bit as she tries to curate her words.

          "Oh, bite me," I hiss. "Wait. Yo- fuh...wuh... How did you fi ‚Äï Ack!

          thunk. I cradle my head and hide my face in the library's lush green
          carpet as I get blanketed.

          "Um, well spoken! Good job! I was mistaken earlier when I called you
          inarticulate," she gently picks the books off, one by one. "I thought
          your babbling a bit daft, um, however... However! I now see it's
          captivating. And laconic."
        </p>

          "Well, it wasn't easy. You would think that being alone in such a

          Every book has the wrong cover. Every door has exit signs, including
          the exits ‚Äï and the frickin' bathrooms!" Her voice revs up like a
          motor at the end.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh? Did that give you trouble?" Muffle muffle.</p>
        <p>
          "No! Why would it?" she snaps. The poor blob on her shoulder is being
          used like a stress ball. "The point is, I had to go gallivanting
          through the entire Library of Babel to get here. If you take the
          service elevator from the North East East wing... Ahh, hold on. This
          isn't what I wanted to say."
        </p>
        <p>
          She reaches her hand out to me again. With some noticeable
          trepidation, this time waiting for me to reach back.
        </p>
        <p>"Um, I'm sorry about earlier," she says, again quite softly.</p>
        <p>I hate myself for adding any clouds to those sunlit eyes.</p>
        <p>
          What's there to be sorry about? She didn't do anything wrong. But what
          happens when a sweeping force of authenticity meets an immovably
          insincere object? We happily get swept along, and act like they're
          imposing.
        </p>
        <p>"...that's alright," I say hollowly, shamelessly taking her hand.</p>
        <p>
          "Now," She puts her hand on her hips, creasing the hem of her
          extravagant jacket. "Now, alright! I'm sure you want to get out of
          here."
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúYeah. Definitely. There‚Äôs nothing else I want more.‚Äù Actually, that‚Äôs
          a lie. What I want the most is actually to go with you even though I
          just met you. I think.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So? Adventure with me?‚Äù she asks, the slightest shakiness in her
          voice. ‚ÄúI can see you're not crazy about me, but I'm sort of your only
          option here."
        </p>
        <p>
          The little bits of self-deprecation she's throwing in on my account
          are slicing me up. This time, I'm not gonna look away. I can do that
          much.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm fine with that ‚Äï going with you I mean. I don't mind it."</p>
        <p>
          "...alright, then." The strain leaves her smile finally. '"Then, the
          two of us should begin our descent."
        </p>
        <p>
          I should really introduce myself. Tell her that it feels like I've
          known her forever.
        </p>
        <p>"Shiori, I uh. I'm ‚Äï ugh!"</p>
        <p>But the books are so loud. So vicious. Can she not hear them?</p>

        <em>"...that dumbass had no idea..."</em
        ><em>"...hate her, hate her, hate her..."</em
        ><em>"...wanted to murder them..."</em>

        <p>
          I just wince and force myself to hear them as white noise. They're
          just crickets. They're just grasshoppers. They're just the sounds of
          my teeth grinding together.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Are you alright?" She looks at me, then all around the arc, then back
          at me again.
        </p>
        <p>"I'm fine. I just need a second. That's all."</p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm not actually fine. But I‚Äôm tired of lashing out at her just
          because of my aching head. Just some noise, right? Whoever got hurt by
          a little noise? She‚Äôs not bothered by it, so it‚Äôs definitely a me
          issue. Why unload on her? We‚Äôll get out of here anyway. We‚Äôll get out
          of here anyway. We‚Äôll get out of here anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          "...You don't look fine," she frowns. Slowly, almost timidly, she rubs
          up and down from the small of my back up to my shoulder blades. If I
          could feel my sense of humor right now, I‚Äôd laugh at such a pretty
          girl hoverhanding. "Though I think I get the issue essentially. Here‚Äï"
        </p>

        <p>
          Shiori glares all around. Then she takes in a deep breath, like she‚Äôs
          about to play drill sergeant.
        </p>
        <p>And then she shushes them.</p>
        <p>
          Soft. So soft. She raises her fingers to her lips and barely breathes
          out, a gentle exhale like she‚Äôs taking care not to startle the piping
          hot soup on her spoon. It should be too quiet to hear, even for me,
          but it's like she blew warm air right into my ear. I yelp, and all the
          books... finally stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's better," she says, clapping her hands together happily. Then
          she glares all around. "Rude, little creatures, are they not? They
          really should shut up when they're in the library."
        </p>

        <p>They actually‚Ä¶ stopped. Oh.</p>
        <p>Huh.</p>
        <p>So, this is what quiet is like.</p>
        <p>
          I'm just here, not moving an inch, and she's shooting me this 'what's
          up now?' look. But I can't help it. There's this wave of relief
          washing over me, and I just need to stop a moment. The noises are
          gone. The headache's gone... Maybe everything that's so messed up
          about me was just‚Äï
        </p>

        <p>"By the way, that was a really cute noise you made."</p>
        <p>"Shut up."</p>
        <p>
          Nevermind. Seems like at least some of it was my actual personality.
